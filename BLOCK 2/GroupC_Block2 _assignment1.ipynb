    "1) *Three basic assumptions of the Langmuir model*\n",
    "There are three main assumptions used to form the Langmuir model, these are : \n",
    "- The adsorbing surface contains a finite number of well-defined, energetically identical sites where adsorption can take place. Each adsorption site is considered as equivalent, meaning every site has the same probability of capturing a molecule \n",
    "- Each site can hold at most one adsorbate molecule. Once a molecule occupies a site, no additonal molecule can adsorb on top of it. This prevents multilayer adsorption and ensures the model describes only the formation of a single layer of molecules on the surface \n",
    "- Adsorbed molecules are assumed to be independant of one another. There are no lateral interactions (attractive or repulsive) between molecules on neighbouring sites. As a result, the adsorption of one molecule does not affect the likelyhood of another molecule adsorbing on a nearby site.  "
